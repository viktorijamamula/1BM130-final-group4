# 1BM130-final-group4

## Libraries and packages used

The following libraries are needed to execute the code of this project. 
* numpy
* pandas
* matplotlib
* Sklearn
* cplex
* plotly
* time
* scipy
* seaborn
* researchpy
* pydotplus
* math
* six
* random
* IPython
* graphviz
* interpretableai - this package is used for the topic 4 - prescriptive analytics and **requires a LICENSE** ( see https://www.interpretable.ai/products/)

## Jupyter notebooks

There are 5 jupyter notebooks submitted for this assignment. These are:
* Pre-processing - involves some general preprocessing steps
* Topic 1 - includes the code on conducting the descriptive analytics
* Topic 2 - includes the code on conducting the behavioral analytics
* Topic 3 - includes the code on conducting the predictive analytics
* Topic 4 - includes the code on conducting the prescriptive analytics

The notebooks are designed to run top to bottom, without errors. However, if not having a license for **interpretableai**, the notebook Topic 4 will produce errors. Therefore all notebooks are saved already with the cell outputs. 

There are also several datasets included in the submission file:
* auctionBehavior
* data_issold_scarse
* dimLot_v3
* factBehavior
* lotBehavior
* data_endprice
* data_endprice2

These datasets are created along the way during the code execution, however might be not in the chronological order. Also, importing the ready datasets would save a lot of time. 
Besides these datasets, the initial datasets from BVA provided at the beginning of the 1BM130 course are needed.
